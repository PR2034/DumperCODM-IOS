The Dumper for CODM is a powerful and versatile tool designed to assist developers, modders, and researchers in analyzing and modifying the binary files of Call of Duty Mobile (CODM). By extracting and decompiling the game’s Il2Cpp binaries, this tool generates C# (CS) files and DLLs, enabling users to create custom mods, analyze game mechanics, and develop cheats such as Wallhack, Aimbot, and Bypass for the Anti-Cheat Engine (ACE). Built with compatibility for .NET 6.0, 8.0, and 9.0, this tool is optimized for modern development environments.

Key Features
Binary Extraction:

Extracts and decompiles the Il2Cpp binaries (codm-binary and global-metadata.dat) from CODM.

Converts Il2Cpp code into readable C# (CS) files for analysis and modification.

DLL Generation:

Compiles the decompiled C# code into DLL files for use in mods and custom game enhancements.

Supports integration with game clients for testing and deployment.

ACE Bypass:

Includes functionality to bypass the Anti-Cheat Engine (ACE) used in CODM.

Allows for testing and development of mods without immediate detection.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Works seamlessly with .NET 6.0, 8.0, and 9.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest development frameworks.

Supports both Windows and Linux environments.

User-Friendly Interface:

Intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for easy operation.

Detailed logs and error messages to assist with troubleshooting.

Custom Mod Development:

Enables the creation of custom mods such as Wallhack, Aimbot, and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).

Provides access to game mechanics and assets for advanced customization.

Educational and Research Use:

Ideal for studying game architecture, reverse engineering, and Il2Cpp internals.

Suitable for academic and non-commercial research purposes.

Technical Details
How It Works
Binary Analysis:

The tool analyzes the codm-binary and global-metadata.dat files to extract Il2Cpp data.

It maps Il2Cpp structures to C# classes and methods.

Decompilation:

The extracted Il2Cpp code is decompiled into C# (CS) files using advanced algorithms.

The output is human-readable and can be modified for custom purposes.

DLL Compilation:

The decompiled C# code is compiled into DLL files using the .NET SDK.

These DLLs can be injected into the game client to enable custom features.

ACE Bypass:

The tool includes techniques to evade detection by the Anti-Cheat Engine (ACE).

This allows for safe testing and deployment of mods.

Compatibility
.NET Versions: Fully compatible with .NET 6.0, 8.0, and 9.0.

Operating Systems: Works on Windows and Linux.

Game Versions: Designed for the latest versions of Call of Duty Mobile.

Use Cases
Game Modding:

Create custom mods such as Wallhack, Aimbot, and ESP.

Modify game mechanics to enhance gameplay.

Reverse Engineering:

Study the Il2Cpp architecture and game internals.

Analyze game logic and asset management.

Anti-Cheat Research:

Investigate the functionality of the Anti-Cheat Engine (ACE).

Develop techniques to bypass or improve anti-cheat systems.

Educational Purposes:

Learn about binary extraction, decompilation, and mod development.

Use the tool in academic or research projects.
